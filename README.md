# TaticsGame
Currently a turn based tatics game that I'm working on in my spare time.  As such, it probably will be finished sometime in 2040.

Honestly, most of the information is scattered through a few notebooks, and I'm writing this as an excuse not to do work, so, this will be updated sometime in the future.  Probably.
